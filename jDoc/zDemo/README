Example on how generate doc from jTcl or C++
--------------------------------------------

Note: Both files are extracted from Rubicon project, javadoc will
      complain on not finding super class, which is normal because
      both file are only raw extract.

How to start 
------------
    ../../bin/jWrap --javadoc --verbose --outdir=/tmp httpdTcp.jTcl 
    javadoc /tmp/*.java

Makefile
--------
    make clean
    make 

Looking true Netscape
---------------------
    Java doc include link to some gif, you should have those GIF accessible
    before looking to html document, usually they are located under

                $JAVA_HOME/docs/api/images

   If you don't find them search for: package-index.gif

   When you have find those gif just link or copy this directory in
   your documentation directory, example:

               ln -s $JAVA_HOME/docs/api/images .

Good luck
